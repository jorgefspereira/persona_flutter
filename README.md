Native implementation of the [Persona Inquiry flow](https://docs.withpersona.com/docs) for Flutter.

This plugin integrates the native v2 SDKs:

- [Persona iOS v2 SDK](https://docs.withpersona.com/docs/android-sdk-v2-integration-guide)
- [Persona Android v2 SDK](https://docs.withpersona.com/docs/ios-sdk-v2-integration-guide)

Feel free to leave any feedback [here](https://github.com/jorgefspereira/persona_flutter/issues).

*Important: Persona stopped support for **v1** on December 31, 2022. If you need the older mobile integration, check the version **2.1.5** of this plugin or **v1** branch of this repository.*

## Installation

Add `persona_flutter` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/).

## iOS

#### Requirements

- iOS 13.0 or later is required.
- Update your `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

    ```xml
    <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
    <string>This app requires access to the camera.</string>
    <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
    <string>This app requires access to the photo library.</string>
    ```
    
Note: Cocoapods 1.9.3 has a bug that prevents builds from selecting the correct architecture. See more details [here.](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/9790) Please downgrade to 1.8.x or upgrade to 1.10.x

#### Privacy

The Persona SDK collects a user’s IDFV for fraud prevention purposes. In App Store Connect > Your App > App Privacy, if you haven’t already add in a “Device Identifier,” and fill out the questionnaire with the following answers:
- Usage: App Functionality (covers fraud prevention)
- Are the device IDs collected from this app linked to the user’s identity? Yes
- Do you or your third-party partners use device IDs for tracking purposes? No

## Android

#### Requirements

- Change the `minSdkVersion` to 21 (or higher) in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
      
- Declare the following permissions:
  
    ```xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
    ```

#### Privacy 

This SDK collects a user’s [App-Set ID](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/app-set-id) for Fraud Prevention purposes. When publishing to the Play Store, disclose the usage of Device Identifiers as follows:
- Data Types: Device or other IDs
- Collected: Yes
- Shared: No
- Processed Ephemerally: No
- Required or Optional: Required
- Purposes: Fraud Prevention

#### Theming

Using the `styles.xml` of your app, you can set colors, buttons and more to customize the Persona flow to your own style. Just extend the base Persona style `Base.Persona.Inquiry.Theme` and name it `Persona.Inquiry.Theme`.

```xml
<style name="Persona.Inquiry.Theme" parent="@style/Base.Persona.Inquiry.Theme">
    <item name="colorPrimary">#22CB8E</item>
    <item name="colorAccent">#22CB8E</item>
    <item name="colorPrimaryDark">#167755</item>
</style>
```

and in your `InquiryConfiguration` set the theme:

```dart
...
theme: InquiryTheme(source: InquiryThemeSource.client)
...
```

*__Important:__ Client side theming is __deprecated__. Themes can be managed in the Dashboard with Persona's visual editor. See the detailed [tutorial](https://help.withpersona.com/articles/6SIHupp847yaEuVMucKAff/tutorial-configure-a-theme-with-flow-editor/) for more information.*
